          Dimitrios Tofalos was a Greek weightlifter. He was a member of both
          Gymnastiki Etaireia Patron and Panachaikos Gymnastikos syllogos, that
          merged in 1923 to become Panachaiki Gymnastiki Enosi. Arguably the
          greatest weightlifter of the early 20th century, he won the gold medal
          in the 1906 Intercalated Games, setting a world record that lasted
          until 1914. Dimitrios Tofalos Arena is named after him. Tofalos'
          herculean strength was obvious from his childhood. Everybody talked
          about his physical abilities and for some time he was considered a
          child prodigy, since he survived a very serious accident. He was
          playing around a railway station, when a wagon came down on him and
          almost smashed his arm. He was taken to hospital where the doctors
          declared that his arm should be amputated. Tofalos' father opposed to
          it and finally proved to be right. His son recovered, but as a result
          of the accident one of his arms was shorter than the other. His
          physical defect did not stop him from becoming one of the greatest
          Greek athletes of all time.

          Georgios Tertsetis was a Greek independence fighter, historian,
          politician, poet, writer, judge and philosopher. He is best known,
          along with Anastasios Polyzoidis, for his refusal to agree to the
          condemnation and execution of Theodoros Kolokotronis and Dimitrios
          Plapoutas, in 1832. In 1833, Tertsetis was appointed a magistrate. His
          is mostly known in Greece as one of the three judges who refused to
          succumb to government pressure and condemn Theodoros Kolokotronis to
          death, a brave act that though put him to exile. The passion of
          Georgios Tertsetis was literature. He wrote many verses and in 1833,
          he published a poem dedicated to King Otto, entitled The Kiss, a poem
          inspired by the folklore language of the common people. However, his
          poetry didn't have much popularity and remains unknown. It was his
          prose that was much appreciated. The most famous work of Tertsetis was
          The Memoirs of Kolokotronis, a narrative biography of the great hero
          of the Greek Revolution. Georgios Tertsetis died in Athens in 1874.

          Tempomeras was a mathematician and leftist teacher and member of the
          Anti-imperialist labor front (EAM). His name became known throughout
          Greece when killed during the student protests of 1990-1991. He was
          killed in Patras on January 8, 1991 at the age of 38 years by the then
          chairman of the local right-wing youth organization (ONNED).
          Temponeras was fatally beaten with crowbar in the head during violent
          incidents in the occupied 3rd High School of Patras. The 1991
          high-school student movement was the most massive ever in Greece,
          involving about 1500 school occupations and demonstrations of hundreds
          of thousands of people. The murder of Nikos Temponeras by thugs of the
          ruling right-wing New Democracy party caused an almost general
          insurgency in all main Greek towns, with a 25,000 strong demonstration
          in Patras where Temponeras was killed, which was followed by the
          burning of the police station and the Town Hall. The same day in
          Athens four people died in a fire which occurred during a massive
          demonstration. The civil unrest stopped only after the minister of
          Education resigned.

          Kostis Palamas was a Greek poet who wrote the words to the Olympic
          Hymn. He was a central figure of the Greek literary generation of the
          1880s and one of the cofounders of the so-called New Athenian School
          along with Georgios Drosinis, Nikos Kampas, and Ioannis Polemis. He
          has been informally called the "national" poet of Greece and was
          closely associated with the struggle to rid Modern Greece of the
          "purist" language and with political liberalism. He dominated literary
          life for 30 or more years and greatly influenced the entire
          political-intellectual climate of his time. Romain Rolland considered
          him the greatest poet of Europe and he was twice nominated for the
          Nobel Prize for Literature but never received it. His most important
          poem,[3] "The Twelve Lays of the Gypsy" (1907), is a poetical and
          philosophical journey. His "Gypsy" is a free-thinking, intellectual
          rebel, a Greek Gypsy in a post-classical, post-Byzantine Greek world,
          an explorer of work, love, art, country, history, religion and
          science, keenly aware of his roots and of the contradictions between
          his classical and Christian heritages.

          Dimitrios Gounaris was the Prime Minister of Greece from 25 February
          to 10 August 1915 and 26 March 1921 to 3 May 1922. Leader of the
          People's Party, he was the main right-wing opponent of his
          contemporary Eleftherios Venizelos.After Venizelos' defeat, he
          controlled most deputies in the parliament, and was the main driving
          force of the following royalist governments, but himself only assumed
          the office of Prime Minister in March 1921. Despite his pre-electoral
          promises over a withdrawal from Asia Minor, unable to find a way for
          an 'honourable' extrication, he continued the war against Turkey.
          Although he was willing to compromise with the Turks, as he showed in
          the London talks in early 1921, in order to step up pressure on the
          Kemalist Turks, he agreed to the launch of the Greek offensive of
          March 1921. The Greek Army was not prepared, and the attack was
          repulsed in the Second Battle of İnönü, resulting in the first Greek
          defeat in the Greco-Turkish War.

          <h2>Ancient Odeum</h2>
          <p>
            The Ancient Odeum of Patras is a majestic building of Roman times
            that has been rebuilt today and used for musical and theatrical
            events. It is located to the west of the Castle, to the Upper Town
            next to the Roman stadium and between the Old Patronas of Germanos,
            Sotiriados, Pantokratoros and St. George Square. It has a frontage
            to the south and is brick-lined, nowadays its stairs are covered
            with marble. The Conservatory was probably constructed in the years
            of August. Pausanias reports that he was older than the Herod
            Atticus Conservatory and was a continuation of the Roman market of
            the city, he was adorned brilliantly but not like the Herod, who
            considered it brighter. In the years that passed the Conservatory
            suffered damage from natural disasters and raids and was buried.
            François Poquelville reports that during his years he was preserving
            his parts in the house enclosure. In 1889 it was decided to demolish
            the Strani hill and the dirt to be used in the embankment of the
            port that was being built at that time, during which the Odeum was
            discovered. From 1959 to 1963, architect Ioannis Vassiliou initiated
            and rehabilitated many of his premises, for which the work was
            honored by the Academy of Athens and the Municipality of Patras.

            The harbor has always played an important role in the economic,
            social and political life of the city and the wider region. Over the
            past century, it has witnessed a period of great flowering as a
            center of raisin trade. The advantages of its geographical location
            have reserved an extended period of acne, which marked the life of
            Patras and shaped to a large extent the characteristics of the local
            economy. Then, the decline and decline of raisin trade,
            congratulated the port on a period of stagnation and later decline,
            which became particularly intense in the first post-war years.
            However, the development of ferry services has led to a new period
            of prosperity that began in the 1960s and continues today with very
            positive prospects.

          <h2>Fortress</h2>
          <p>
            The Patras Fortress was built around the mid-6th century above the
            ruins of the ancient acropolis, on a low outlying hill of the
            Panachaiko Mountain. The castle covers 22,725 m² and consists of a
            triangular outer wall, strengthened by towers and gates and further
            protected originally by a moat, and an inner compound on the
            northeastern corner, also protected by a moat. The first castle on
            the spot was built by Byzantine emperor Justinian I after the
            catastrophic earthquake of 551, re-using building material from
            pre-Christian structures. The fort remained in constant use
            thereafter, even until the Second World War. In the Byzantine
            period, it was besieged by Slavs, Saracens, Normans and many others,
            but it never fell. In particular, the successful repulsion of a
            great siege of 805 AD by the Arabs and the Slavs was attributed to
            the city's patron saint, St Andrew.

            completed in 1872. The Apollon is located east of Georgiou I Square,
            one of Patras' popular squares. The theatre is a micrograph of the
            La Scala in Milan and is the oldest existing enclosed theatre of the
            same era. The Apollon Theatre has been the main stage of the Patras
            Municipal and Regional Theatre since 1988, and can hold up to 300

            and opened on October 10, 1872. The construction was paid for by
            various residents of Patras. The main erection committee included
            Theodor Hamburger, Dimitrios Patrinos, K. Lappas and A. Chrysanthis.
            Other sponsors included the then-mayor of Patras, Georgios Roufos,
